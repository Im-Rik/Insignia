Of course. A good `README.md` is essential for any project. It serves as the front door and the instruction manual for new users and potential collaborators.

Based on our entire journey, here is a complete, detailed `README.md` file for your project. You can copy and paste this directly into a `README.md` file in the root of your GitHub repository.

# Real-Time Sign Language Recognition

This project is a full-stack web application that uses a live camera feed to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time. It leverages computer vision with MediaPipe for landmark detection and a custom-trained PyTorch deep learning model on the backend for classification.

*(**Note:** You should record a GIF of the working application and replace the link above to showcase your project.)*

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Real-time Hand, Pose, & Face Tracking:** Utilizes Google's MediaPipe Holistic to extract 1,662 data points per frame from the user's video feed, right in the browser.
  * **Live AI Predictions:** Keypoint data is streamed via WebSockets to a Python backend for inference with a custom-trained LSTM model.
  * **Modern Frontend:** Built with React (using Vite) and styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and polished user experience.
  * **Dynamic UI:** Features a "Current Sign" display that animates on new predictions and a scrollable history log with timestamps and confidence scores.
  * **Developer Dashboard:** A dedicated developer mode with real-time analytics, including Frames Per Second (FPS) of the vision model and detected keypoint counts.
  * **Loading Indicators:** Provides clear user feedback while the camera and AI models are initializing.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  * **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.
  * **Node.js:** Version 18.x or higher.
  * **pip:** Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
  * **npm:** Node.js package manager (comes with Node.js).
  * **A Webcam:** Required for the live video feed.
  * **(Optional but Recommended) NVIDIA GPU:** For faster model inference on the backend using CUDA. The application will fall back to CPU if a GPU is not available.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your local development environment set up. It's recommended to have two separate terminal windows open, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

### 1\. Backend Setup

First, let's set up the Python server.



1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project/backend
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    *This is a best practice to keep project dependencies isolated.*

    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install flask flask-socketio flask-cors numpy torch torchvision torchaudio eventlet
    ```

    *(Note: `eventlet` is a recommended high-performance server for Flask-SocketIO).*

4.  **Place the Model File:**

      * Place your trained PyTorch model file, `sign_recognizer_best.pth`, in this same backend directory. The application will fail to start if it cannot find this file.

### 2\. Frontend Setup

Now, let's set up the React application.

1.  **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project/frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node Modules:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Local MediaPipe Files:**

      * For reliable performance, this project hosts the MediaPipe model files locally.
      * Navigate to your project's `node_modules/@mediapipe/holistic/` folder.
      * **Copy all files** from within this directory (e.g., `.wasm`, `.js`, `.binarypb` files).
      * Paste all of these files directly into the `frontend/public/` directory. This step is crucial to avoid 404 errors.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**

      * In your first terminal (in the backend directory with the virtual environment activated):

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    python app_realtime.py
    ```

      * You should see output indicating that the Flask-SocketIO server is running on `http://0.0.0.0:5000/`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**

      * In your second terminal (in the frontend directory):

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

      * Vite will start the development server, typically on a port like `5173`. Your terminal will provide the exact URL.

3.  **Open the App:**

      * Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the Vite server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
      * The application should load, connect to the backend, and be ready for use. Select `developer-mode-1` and click "Start Video" to begin.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application operates on a client-server model designed for real-time performance:

1.  **Client (Browser):** The React app uses `getUserMedia` to access the webcam.
2.  **MediaPipe Vision:** On each video frame, MediaPipe Holistic runs within the browser to extract 1662 keypoints for the pose, face, and hands.
3.  **WebSocket Emission:** This array of keypoints is sent to the backend via a Socket.IO WebSocket connection on the `live_keypoints` event.
4.  **Server (Python):** The Flask-SocketIO server receives the stream of keypoints. It maintains a sliding window (a buffer of 60 frames) for each connected client.
5.  **AI Inference:** Once the buffer is full, the entire sequence of 60 frames is passed to the PyTorch LSTM model for a prediction.
6.  **Prediction Response:** The model's top prediction and its confidence score are sent back to the originating client on the `prediction_result` event.
7.  **UI Update:** The React frontend receives the prediction and dynamically updates the "Current Sign" display and the "Prediction History" log.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

This project serves as a powerful foundation. Future work could include:

  * **Improving Model Accuracy:** The top priority is to expand the training dataset with more varied examples to improve prediction accuracy and expand the vocabulary.
  * **Adding Latency Metrics:** Implementing a round-trip time metric in the developer analytics to measure a true end-to-end performance.
  * **Sign Boundary Detection:** Developing a more advanced system to better detect the start and end of a sign, preventing duplicate predictions for a single, held gesture.
  * **User Mode UI:** Finalizing the UI for `user-mode-1` by applying the new components and hiding the developer-centric panels.
